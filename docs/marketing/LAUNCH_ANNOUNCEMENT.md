### 🎉 Introducing Lucidity: Your Terminal, Everywhere

We're excited to announce the first public release of **Lucidity** — a mobile app that lets you control your desktop terminal from your phone.

Built on top of [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), Lucidity brings the power of your command line to your pocket.
