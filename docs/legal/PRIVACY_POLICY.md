# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 18, 2026**

Lucidity ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service").

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 No Server-Side Storage of Terminal Data
We do **not** store, log, or analyze the contents of your terminal sessions. All terminal data transmitted between your mobile device and your desktop is **end-to-end encrypted** and ephemeral. It passes through our relay server (if used) but is never persisted.

### 1.2 Device Data
We may collect minimal device information (e.g., model, OS version) for crash reporting and app stability.

### 1.3 Usage Data
We may collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., number of active sessions, session duration) to improve the Service.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
*   **To provide the Service**: To route encrypted traffic between your devices.
*   **To improve the Service**: To fix bugs and optimize performance.

## 3. Data Security
We use industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2/1.3, Ed25519 authentication) to protect your connections. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party services for:
*   **Crash Reporting**: (e.g., Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics)
*   **App Distribution**: (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store)

These services have their own privacy policies.

## 5. Children's Privacy
Our Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
